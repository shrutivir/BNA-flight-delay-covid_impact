# BNA-flight-delay-covid_impact
This capstone project analyzes flight performance at Nashville International Airport (BNA) with a focus on departure delays, arrival delays, and cancellations across major U.S. airlines. The goal is to understand how airline operations at BNA were affected before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, and how recovery patterns varied by airline.
